# To-Do
This repository contains an Angular application for managing a "To-Do" list with full CRUD functionality. The project's goal is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to create, read, update, and delete their to-do items.

## Features:

- Add new to-do items
- View and display the to-do list
- Update to-do descriptions and completion status
- Delete to-do items

## Technologies:

- Angular framework for the frontend development
- JSON Server as a simulated backend API for data persistence
- Well-structured components and services
- Basic styling for a clean and visually appealing look
- Basic routing for easy navigation
- Improved error handling mechanisms
- Responsive design for optimal user experience on various screen sizes
  
## Getting Started:

Clone this repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies: npm install
Start the JSON Server backend API: npm run start:backend
Start the Angular application: npm start (ng serve -o )
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200

## Project Structure:

/src - Contains the Angular application source code
/components - Contains reusable components
/services - Contains services for data management and API communication
/Model - Contains the interfaces
db.json - Contains the data for the to-do items (used by JSON Server)

## Note:
For the application to work properly, ensure that the JSON Server backend API is running. The backend API provides a simulated RESTful API for data persistence, allowing you to interact with the to-do items.

Thank you for your interest in this project!
